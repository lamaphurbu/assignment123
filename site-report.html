					<h1>Experience of web developing</h1>
					<p>Learning web development has been one of the most interesting thing that i have learned.When we were tasked to make web pages I continued coding for many hours.I only stopped when there were bugs which I couldn't debug even after many tries.Sometime bugs made me frustrated but after refreshing myself I continued trying to debug.I have learned a lot through online.I even inspected other website so I could learn many new things.It has become very exciting to learn,code and debug.</p>
